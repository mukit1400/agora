<h2>Inspiration</h2>
We believe that public art has the power to express the visions of local citizens and artists, and re-engage the community through public spaces. In the virtual space, members of the community don't have to depend on corporate sponsorships to create and install their art. Agora empowers members of the community to

<h2>What it does</h2>
Agora uses AR to allow users to create 3D art, and virtually install their pieces at public spaces around their current area. Then, members of the community can use the heat-map function to see the density of Agora art pieces in any area in the world. As they move around their current location, they use the art viewer in the mobile app to discover user-submitted artworks. Users can also review artworks submitted by their fellow citizens and upvote/downvote. When viewing art, users can choose to see all user-submitted work, top 5 submitted works, only their own works, and can also use the timeline function to see how users have installed and deleted works over time.

<h2>How we built it</h2>
Our starting point was a Google Labs ARCore test project called â€œJust a Line." From there we extended into our existing product adding capabilities that encourage social collaboration and permanent record of the art pieces.
